# Squid Facts
* Squid are a type of *cephalopod*
   * Cephalopods are a completely merged head and foot, with a ring of arms and/or tentacles surrounding the head
> I don't just like squid, I also like octopi, which are also cephalopods.
* All squid have **three** hearts
* A squid moves through the water tail-first, rather than head-first.
* One of a squids defence mechanisms is its ink sac, which can rapidly release a black substance

For the sake of using a table, I will put some facts in a table:
| Fact | Fact pt2|
| --- | --- |
|Squids have beaks| This beak cannot be digested by other animals|
|Some squids glow in the dark| This is due to ***bioluminescent*** organs|
